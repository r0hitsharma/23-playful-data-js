[ ] improve sounds. build soundscape. find more randomSounds. 
[ ] make all stages of the animation
[ ] trees regenerate in an area that's burned down totally

play:
[ ] add instructions at the start.
[ ] if the person's never clicked on the forest, inform them that they can
[ ] [maybe not needed] if a person doesn't click on the forest for a long time, show a news story
[ ] different messaging depending on the gamestate/timed-conclusion of the playful experience. eg: good news comes when the person is doing well, and not randomly.
[ ] add "good news" and "bad news" explicitly at the top of each news article.
[ ] strengthen design future/fiction narrative.
[ ] add a (well-timed) conclusion or reward to the experience. maybe also add some score system while people are playing it.
[ ] add scrollability to the forest, so a person can go down and read the larger article. when a person scrolls, the forest stops.

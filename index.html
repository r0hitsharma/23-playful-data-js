		<h1>The Gender Wage Gap</h1>

			<p>
				The 2023 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences — the ‘economics Nobel’ — has been awarded to economic
				historian Claudia Goldin at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, “for having advanced our
				understanding
				of women’s labour market outcomes.”
			</p>

			<p>
				Goldin’s work has helped to explain why women have been under-represented in the labour market for at least
				the
				past two centuries, and why even today they continue to earn less than men on average (by around 13%).
			</p>

			<p>
				Although such inequalities are widely recognized, they present a puzzle for economic models because they
				represent
				not just a potential injustice, but also what economists call a market inefficiency. Women seem to be both
				under-utilized and under-incentivized in the labour force, even though those in high-income countries
				typically
				now have a higher educational level than do men.
			</p>

			<p>
				Goldin brought history to bear on this question through rigorous forensic analysis of how changes in women’s
				participation in the labour force have been influenced by social, political and technological change over
				the past
				two centuries.
			</p>

			<p>
				“The strength of her work comes from combining careful and innovative historical data with insights from
				economic
				theories of wage determination, employment, discrimination and the political economy,” says economist
				Claudia
				Olivetti at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.
			</p>

			<p>
				Discrimination shows itself in many forms, perhaps even a way you are experiencing right now?
			</p>

			<p>
				Before Goldin’s studies, it was widely thought that the increase in the proportion of women in work over the
				course of the twentieth century was a reflection of economic growth — higher growth meant more women in
				employment. But by looking back carefully at older historical records, Goldin showed that the proportion of
				married women involved in paid work (for example in agriculture or textiles manufacturing) was at least as
				high in
				the late eighteenth century, when economic growth rates were much lower, as it is today. This industry was
				generally hidden behind an opaque census designation of ‘wife.’
			</p>

			<p>
				Goldin showed that industrialization disrupted this pattern by making it harder for women to work from home.
				Her
				identification of a U-shaped curve in women’s labour participation over 200 years, published in her 1990
				book
				Understanding the Gender Gap, demolished the notion of a simplistic link to economic growth.
			</p>

			<p>
				Goldin also demonstrated that, although work opportunities for women expanded in the twentieth century,
				especially
				in societies in which children leave the parental home, they were not exploited as much as they could have
				been.
			</p>

			<p>
				Goldin has also shown how gender inequalities in pay have not followed a simple relationship with economic
				growth,
				either. The pay gap was smaller during the industrial revolution of 1820–50, for example, because demand for
				clerical services increased, but changed little between 1930 and 1980, when rewards for uninterrupted
				careers
				promoted de facto wage discrimination. Goldin and Katz, with economist Marianne Bertrand, showed in 2010
				that
				parenthood has a key role in maintaining pay inequality, largely through loss of earnings when women suspend
				or
				restrict work in favour of child-rearing.

			<p>
				Goldin’s research has dismantled simple ideas about how gender inequalities in labour markets have changed
				and the
				reasons for these changes. Although she has tended not to make policy recommendations for how the problems
				might
				be addressed, her scrupulous work in looking at the issues through the lens of history can help to show
				which
				interventions are more or less likely to succeed.

			<p>
				However, not all of these ideas and solutions will have universal applicability. Naila Kabeer, who studies
				gender
				in international development at the London School of Economics, points out, for example, that the U-shaped
				curve
				in female labour-force participation has not proved to hold globally.
			</p>

			<p>
				“It was based on the idea that developing countries would go through the same processes as did advanced
				industrialized ones,” she says, “and did not take account that globalization would allow countries to move
				from
				farming to female-intensive industrialization processes quite as fast as they did.”

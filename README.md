# 23-playful-data

## why did we explore this?

data envelops us, and influences how we're controlled. however, it is opaque and un-affective. publicly, it is manifest through essays, graphs-and-charts (rectangles and circles), and dashboards â€” overexposure to it makes us numb to it, and at best only mildly affected. so we'd like to make it a little playful, perhaps interactive, and certainly more memorable. we'd also like to make things that can be distributed en masse (instead of being niche (like ar), or requiring special apps or hardware (like vr), or more expensive to distribute (think: print)), and so should work right off the bat on a mobile-browser.
